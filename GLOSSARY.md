"Platform as a Service": [Heroku](http://heroku.com) is the best known example. (It's also one of the best.) Instead of managing your own Linux VM on a hosting provider, you manage your _app_. 

In the example of Heroku, the apps are hosted Linux. (Ubuntu, to be exact, on AWS.) The difference is that Heroku takes care of all the details like security, operating system upgrades, and network configuration. And then you can focus on providing business value by spending time on the application itself.
