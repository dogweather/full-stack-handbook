# The Development Environment


## Set up Your Terminal

Here's the default Terminal appearance:

Professional programmers don't use it that way, though. We customize the hell out of the terminal, making it more personally usable.

Customizations that were applied:

* Font changed to [Adobe Source Code Pro](http://adobe-fonts.github.io/source-code-pro/)
* Changed the default font size
* Window set to a good default size, 90 columns x 35 rows
* Light text on a dark background
* Customized text in the window bar
* Colorized output (part of *Set up the Shell*, below)
* Unimportant information removed from the prompt (part of *Set up the Shell*, below)
