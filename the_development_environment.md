Customizations you can see above:

* New font: [Adobe Source Code Pro](http://adobe-fonts.github.io/source-code-pro/)
* Window set to a good default size, 90 columns x 35 rows.
* Light text on a dark background
* Colorized output (part of *Set up the Shell*, below)
* Unimportant information removed from the prompt (part of *Set up the Shell*, below)
