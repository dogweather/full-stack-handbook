# Git and GitHub

## How Git Works

**The #1, most important thing to know** about git is how it works.

Git is a linked list of commits. Here's a simple linked list:

If this makes perfect sense to you, then you can skip this section. Otherwise, keep reading; **do not** go on until you understand what this means.

[TBD: show git commits as linked list in various forms]


As Philip Nilsson writes, [learning to expertly use Git means learning how to manipulate that data structure](http://www.jayway.com/2013/03/03/git-is-a-purely-functional-data-structure/).
